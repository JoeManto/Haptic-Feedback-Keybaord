Haptic Feedback Keyboard 

Keyboard extension that provides the default keyboard experience while providing a small vibration for each key press.  
 
Originally a closed source project, but now open source due to a limitation in the TapicEngine API that prevents the use of the Tapic Engine in extensions. Works on iOS versions < 13
